# Tailwind CSS Upgrade Summary

## What Was Done

### Issue Identified
The project was initially set up with Tailwind CSS v4 beta (`@tailwindcss/postcss@^4.0.0`), which caused compatibility issues with Next.js 15. The v4 beta had breaking changes in configuration syntax and wasn't stable for production use.

### Resolution
1. **Removed Tailwind CSS v4 beta** - Uninstalled `@tailwindcss/postcss`
2. **Installed stable Tailwind CSS v3** - Added `tailwindcss@^3.4.17` as a devDependency
3. **Fixed PostCSS configuration** - Updated `postcss.config.mjs` to use standard plugins
4. **Updated CSS structure** - Changed from v4's `@import "tailwindcss"` to v3's `@tailwind` directives
5. **Maintained custom theming** - Preserved all custom CSS variables and theming system
6. **Fixed configuration file** - Recreated `tailwind.config.ts` with proper v3 syntax

### Current Setup
- **Tailwind CSS**: v3.4.17 (stable, production-ready)
- **PostCSS**: v8.5.6 with autoprefixer
- **Configuration**: Standard Tailwind v3 configuration with custom theme extensions
- **CSS**: Proper `@tailwind base`, `@tailwind components`, `@tailwind utilities` directives
- **Theming**: Full dark mode support with CSS custom properties

### Verification
- ✅ Build passes successfully
- ✅ Development server runs without errors
- ✅ All UI components maintain their styling
- ✅ Custom theming system preserved
- ✅ Dark mode functionality intact

## Key Files Modified
- `package.json` - Updated dependencies
- `postcss.config.mjs` - Fixed plugin configuration
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Recreated with v3 syntax
- `src/app/globals.css` - Updated to use proper @tailwind directives and @layer structure

## Recommendation
Stick with Tailwind CSS v3 for production applications. While v4 introduces exciting features, it's still in beta and not recommended for production use until it reaches stable release.
